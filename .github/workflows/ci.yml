# .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# WHY WE HAVE THIS FILE:
# CI/CD = Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
#
# Every time you push code to GitHub, this file runs automatically.
# It:
#   1. Installs all your dependencies
#   2. Runs your tests (pytest)
#   3. If tests pass → code is safe to deploy
#   4. If tests fail → GitHub shows a red X and won't deploy broken code
#
# This is standard practice in every tech company.
# No code reaches production without passing automated tests first.
# Netflix, Google, Razorpay — all use this exact pattern.
